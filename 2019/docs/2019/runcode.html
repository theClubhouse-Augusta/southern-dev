On his convoluted path to cybersecurity he obtained a Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering from the United States Military Academy and a Masters Degree in Computer Science from Rice University focusing on multi-robot systems. 
 In his spare time, Josh serves as the executive director and challenge developer for the RunCode.ninja programming challenge non-profit where he works with a talented team of individuals to provide real-world programming challenges while cultivating community support at no-cost to the broader community. 
 Finally, he is passionate about teaching and giving back to the community through volunteering his time as a technical mentor for CyberPatriot, managing the RunCode.ninja non-profit, and mentoring local talent within the cyber domain.</p></div><div class="team-member"><div class="activator"><img src="../images/runcode-ohai.jpg"><h3>Zach McElroy<br>ohai</h3></div><p>Hi, I'm Zach. When I'm not chatting online with babes all day, you'll probably find me Blue Teaming or writing/building infrastructure to support Blue Team OPs. I like to write Python when possible, or C and PHP if I'm feeling exceptionally masochistic. 
 I don't have any fancy degrees or even much book lern'n, so I stick to building/maintaining the RunCode platform and writing up some challenges here and there.</p></div><div class="team-member"><div class="activator"><img src="../images/runcode-funtimes.jpg"><h3>Scott Hamilton<br>funtimes</h3></div><p>Scott Hamilton is a Cyber Operations Warrant Officer in the United States Army. He currently serves as one of the lead developers and systems architect for the Network, Engineering, Research, and Development shop for the Cyber Protection Brigade. 
 In his free time he is one of five challenge developers that contribute to RunCode platform.</p></div><div class="team-member"><div class="activator"><img src="../images/runcode-nazwadi.jpg"><h3>Nate Hicks<br>nazwadi</h3></div><p>Nathan Hicks is a Cyberspace operations officer in the US Army where he was previously involved in the development and execution of training exercises for Cyber Protection Teams, as well as leading operations for the same.  He is currently finishing an Army Advanced Civil Schooling assignment at Georgia Tech where he will graduate with an M.S. Cybersecurity in May.  He obtained a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the United States Military Academy. 
 In his spare time, Nathan serves as a challenge developer and part-time sysadmin for RunCode, takes care of administrative tasks on behalf of the non-profit, and on a personal level enjoys experimenting with Linux infrastructure and coding projects.</p></div><div class="team-member"><div class="activator"><img src="../images/runcode-thatguy.png"><h3>Matt Bledsoe<br>thatguy</h3></div><p>Matthew Bledsoe is a Software Engineer at St Jude Children's Research Hospital where he provides support migrating cutting edge cancer research out of the laboratory and into clinical usage.  He also serves as a Cyber Operations Technician in the US Army Reserves.  He has a B.S. in Electrical Engineering, B.S in Computer Engineering, and a M.S. in Electrical Engineering.  How that landed him in healthcare and cyber security is still a mystery. 
 Outside of work you'll find him still behind a computer playing games, breaking his homelab, or working on RunCode.  Matthew is the newest member of the team, so if anything is broken it is safe to assume he is to blame.</p></div></div></section></main><footer class="footerMain"><div class="clubhouse"><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://theclubhou.se/"> Organized by theClubhou.se and friends</a><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://theclubhou.se/"><img src="images/theclubhouse.png" alt="Blue circle surrounding a big C with theClubhouse written inside"></a></div><div class="main"><ul><li><ul id="social"><li><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/SouthernDevConference"><i class="fab fa-facebook-square"></i></a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/sodevcon"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sodevcon/about/"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li></ul></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:info@southerndev.co"><i class="far fa-envelope"></i> info@southerndev.co</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://augustadevs.github.io/">❤️ by Augusta Devs</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/theClubhouse-Augusta/southern-dev"><i class="fab fa-github"></i> Our code</a></li></ul></div></footer></div>
