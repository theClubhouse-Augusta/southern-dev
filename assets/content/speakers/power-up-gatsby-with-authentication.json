  "talkDescription": "Gatsby is an amazing platform for building static sites, but it can also pull in dynamic data from outside APIs! Wouldn’t it be awesome if we could also have a user profile with access to protected data? Like Mario’s fire flower or Link’s hook shot, adding authentication will power up your dynamic Gatsby site. In this talk, you’ll learn how to set up logging in and out of a Gatsby site, access protected data, and handle silent authentication when the page reloads. You’ll also learn some tips and tricks to avoid common pitfalls with authentication in Gatsby. By the end, you’ll be ready for the next level of your Gatsby quest!"
